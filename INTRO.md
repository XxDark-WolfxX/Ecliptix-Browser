# Welcome, to the Ecliptix Browser!
--------------------------------------
While this may seem like just another browser 
that someone made just to get a quick buck, I,
the developer herself, can assure you that it's
not. It's optimized for **BOTH** privacy and customization, and colpetely built on it's own. Is is a fork of Gecko, yes. But it's better in a way that Firefox fails.

While Firefox is private, you have limitaions of customizations. And most of them have to do with what is only in the browser. Nothng about how it launches, or the animations, sounds, tab styles - not just the colors -, or even modifications that launches a specialized instance for a specific WebApp.

So Chrome takes up some of that slack though, right? Wrong, because while it has *slightly* more customization, they use your data to train their AI models. Yes, you heard us right, they use __**YOUR**__ data to train thei AI. Edge is just a Microsoft-ified chromum browser. Thus, they do the same.

Opera is a whole other mess that we cannot get into. All we can say is that it also is built on chromium, max privacy, minimum cusomization (unless you count Opera GX). 

Thus, this is the rare multiplatform browser that is smack-dab in the middle.

As we say here ad Cypercliptix Labs, Privacy and Personalization is just a world away. Enjoy your browser. 

Thank you,
