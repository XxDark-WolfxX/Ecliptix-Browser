# Shadow-Wolf-Browser
## This is a chromium browser that is based on privacy and personalization first.

I wanted to build a browser that can compete wtith Firefox, Opera, and others when 
it comes to privacey. I know that they are customizable... to a point.
But with Shadow Wolf, you can have full customizing contol _**WITHOUT**_ 
sacrificeing privacy. You can conifdently say that your privacy will not be sold to 
the big tech companies for "how do devs use our source code?", because it removes all 
things that comprimise your privacy.
